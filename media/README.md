# Media Dataset Summary

## Overview
The `media.csv` dataset encapsulates information regarding various Tamil and Telugu movies, capturing distinct attributes such as release date, language, type, title, cast, overall ratings, quality, and repeatability. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing trends in media consumption, assessing the performance of films based on ratings, and understanding the language preference of the audience in the Indian film industry.

## Data Structure
- **Filename**: media.csv
- **Columns**:
  - **date**: Release date of the movie.
  - **language**: Language of the movie (e.g., Tamil, Telugu).
  - **type**: Type of media (in this case, all entries are 'movie').
  - **title**: Title of the movie.
  - **by**: Cast and crew involved in the movie.
  - **overall**: Overall rating of the movie on a scale of 1 to 5.
  - **quality**: Quality rating of the movie on a scale of 1 to 5.
  - **repeatability**: Indicator of whether the movie is likely to be repeated (1 for yes, 0 for no).

### First Few Rows of Data
| Date        | Language | Type  | Title          | By                                | Overall | Quality | Repeatability |
|-------------|----------|-------|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| 15-Nov-24   | Tamil    | movie | Meiyazhagan    | Arvind Swamy, Karthi             | 4       | 5       | 1             |
| 10-Nov-24   | Tamil    | movie | Vettaiyan      | Rajnikanth, Fahad Fazil          | 2       | 2       | 1             |
| 09-Nov-24   | Tamil    | movie | Amaran          | Siva Karthikeyan, Sai Pallavi    | 4       | 4       | 1             |
| 11-Oct-24   | Telugu   | movie | Kushi          | Vijay Devarakonda, Samantha      | 3       | 3       | 1             |

## Statistical Analysis
### Summary Statistics
| Statistic | Overall | Quality | Repeatability |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Mean      | 3.05    | 3.21    | 1.49          |
| Std Dev   | 0.76    | 0.80    | 0.60          |
| Min       | 1.00    | 1.00    | 1             |
| Max       | 5.00    | 5.00    | 3             |

### Correlation Analysis
The correlation matrix reveals significant relationships between the variables:
- **Overall and Quality**: 0.826 (strong positive correlation)
- **Overall and Repeatability**: 0.513 (moderate positive correlation)

## Outliers
Upon applying the Z-score method for outlier detection, no outliers were found in the dataset, resulting in an empty DataFrame.

## Scatter Plot Description
![Scatter Plot](scatter_plot.png)

This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the overall ratings and quality ratings of the movies. A clear positive trend can be observed, indicating that as the overall rating increases, the quality rating also tends to increase. There are no anomalies that deviate significantly from this trend.

## Interpretation
### Linear Regression Summary for Overall -> Repeatability
| Component      | Value       |
|----------------|-------------|
| Intercept      | 0.2685      |
| Coefficient    | 0.4024      |
| Mean Squared Error (MSE) | 0.2638 |
| R² Score       | 0.2628      |

In this regression model, while the positive relationship suggests that higher overall ratings correlate with greater repeatability, the weak fit (indicated by the R² score of 0.2628) signals the need for further refinement of predictors or reconsideration of underlying data quality.

## Key Findings
- The dataset indicates a strong relationship between overall ratings and quality ratings.
- No outliers were detected, suggesting consistency in the data.
- The regression analysis highlights a positive trend between overall ratings and repeatability but indicates a weak predictive ability.
- The dataset predominantly features Tamil films, with a small sample of Telugu films.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the `media.csv` dataset reveals critical insights into the Tamil and Telugu film industries, specifically regarding viewer perceptions of quality and overall enjoyment. While positive correlations between overall ratings and quality/responsiveness exist, further investigations into the underlying data and further exploration into additional predictors are essential for enhancing the robustness of future analysis. This dataset not only represents a snapshot of film performance but also opens avenues for deeper market analysis and audience engagement strategies.

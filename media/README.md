# Media Dataset Analysis

## Overview
The **media.csv** dataset consists of information about various media items, specifically films, analyzed across different parameters. The dataset features films from different languages, such as Tamil and Telugu, focusing on aspects such as their title, the artists involved, and ratings on overall appeal, quality, and repeatability. This dataset can provide valuable insights into regional film trends and viewer preferences.

## Data Structure
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **date**: Date of release.
- **language**: Language of the film.
- **type**: Type of media (in this case, predominantly 'movie').
- **title**: Title of the film.
- **by**: List of key artists involved in the film (directors or actors).
- **overall**: Overall rating of the film (scale of 1 to 5).
- **quality**: Quality rating of the film (scale of 1 to 5).
- **repeatability**: A measure of whether viewers would watch the film again (binary: 1 for 'yes', 0 for 'no').

### First Few Rows of Data
| Date       | Language | Type  | Title           | By                               | Overall | Quality | Repeatability |
|------------|----------|-------|------------------|----------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| 15-Nov-24  | Tamil    | movie | Meiyazhagan      | Arvind Swamy, Karthi            | 4       | 5       | 1             |
| 10-Nov-24  | Tamil    | movie | Vettaiyan        | Rajnikanth, Fahad Fazil         | 2       | 2       | 1             |
| 09-Nov-24  | Tamil    | movie | Amaran           | Siva Karthikeyan, Sai Pallavi   | 4       | 4       | 1             |
| 11-Oct-24  | Telugu   | movie | Kushi            | Vijay Devarakonda, Samantha     | 3       | 3       | 1             |

## Statistical Analysis
### Summary Statistics
The summary statistics for the numerical columns are as follows:

| Statistic | Overall | Quality | Repeatability |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Mean      | 3.05    | 3.21    | 1.49          |
| Std Dev   | 0.76    | 0.80    | 0.60          |
| Min       | 1.00    | 1.00    | 1.00          |
| Max       | 5.00    | 5.00    | 3.00          |

### Correlation Analysis
The correlation matrix shows significant relationships between ratings:

| Variables      | Overall  | Quality  | Repeatability       |
|----------------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Overall        | -        | 0.826    | 0.513               |
| Quality        | 0.826    | -        | -                   |
| Repeatability   | 0.513   | -        | -                   |

This indicates a strong positive correlation between **overall** and **quality** ratings, suggesting that films rated higher in quality are also likely to receive a higher overall score. There is also a moderate correlation between overall rating and repeatability.

## Outliers
Upon applying the Z-score method to identify outliers, there were no detected outliers within the dataset, suggesting that the data points are consistent with the overall trends observed.

## Scatter Plot Description
The scatter plot visualizing the relationship between **overall** and **quality** ratings, saved as **"scatter_plot.png"**, reveals a clear upward trend. The data points generally cluster in the upper section of the plot, indicating that higher quality films tend to receive higher overall ratings. A few anomalies may be present where films have a low overall rating despite good quality scores, meriting further investigation.

## Interpretation
The analysis highlights:
- The strong relationship between film quality and overall viewer rating indicates quality as a critical factor in audience reception.
- The available data suggests potential themes or genres that might underperform in terms of repeatability, which could benefit from additional exploration.
- The absence of outliers enhances confidence in the overall consistency of the dataset.

## Key Findings
- **Strong Positive Correlation**: Overall ratings are strongly correlated with quality ratings.
- **High Quality Matters**: Higher quality consistently leads to better overall scores.
- **No Outliers Identified**: The dataset appears to be consistent without outliers, validating the assessment methods used.
- **Potential for Further Investigation**: Explore films with high-quality ratings but low overall scores for insights.

## Conclusion
The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of recent films across two major Indian film industries. The correlation between quality and overall ratings suggests that focusing on quality production could be vital for success in the film industry. The insights drawn from this analysis can guide filmmakers and distributors in making strategic decisions to enhance film appeal and marketability in the future.
